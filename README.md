# DRAFT (Alpha) v0.1

> This is a draft (alpha) standard. Please [contact us](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf7BN-I_-sZxhkgcVALyEztE2KFRw-o-jPCWNkLExjRIYRhGQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) with questions or feedback. We are especially keen to hear from individuals and organisations interested in moving this standard forward.

## Why a reuse Open Data Standard?

Packaging pollution is ubiquitous and impossible to ignore; where other types of pollution may be “invisible”, we are faced with daily evidence of this broken system. Companies and consumers across the world are pushing for change, as we collectively acknowledge that our single-use culture has to evolve.

The opportunity for an Open Data Standard to accelerate and de-risk the shift towards reusable products (especially packaging) is significant.

### Whitepaper

[This whitepaper](https://reath.id/reuseid) presents research into the potential for an Open Data Standard and digital tracking to aid and accelerate the transition to circular packaging systems.

The paper identifies the findings from research conducted across the packaging ecosystem that led to this draft Open Standard. It also seeks to recognise the challenges that businesses face on their journey to adopting more circular systems.

## Summary

The goal of this Open Standard, is to identify and standardise definitions that will support the launch, scaling, analysis and regulation of safe, optimised and compliant reuse systems. 

Our hope is this standard will eventually:

- Create a shared Vocabulary: Common definitions ensure everyone understands what words mean in the context of the data being collected or analysed.

- Facilitate data transfer & sharing: enabling organisations (including reuse business, environmental regulators and researchers) to share *only* the data that is relevant, while enabling the wider goal of improving and growing reuse business models.

## What vs How

This draft standard defines the "what" of the reuse data for the purposes of shared understanding. It does not attempt to define:

- How the data is made available (e.g. API endpoints or direct download of data files etc).
- How the data is stored.
- How physcial reusable assets are tagged and tracked. The standard enables, but does not proscribe, tagging each individual asset (e.g. with QR Codes, NFC or RFID) and tracking it through the resuse cycle.

## Open vs Closed data

The standard itself is Open for the purposes of shared understanding. The standard does not *require* that any actual data sets be made "Open" and available to all.  

The standard does enable organisations to choose which data to share publically (if any) and also enables more detailed data to be shared only with trusted parties or regulators.
